# Market Project

### Basic software for the administration of a company, mainly focused on local markets and sales. The software aims at cataloging customers, suppliers, products and sales of a particular store.

Hi everyone, I developed this project during college with the purpose of learning and improving my object oriented skills with an interface. If you're interested, feel free to download it, use it and improve it any way you want. I hope I helped in some way.

Developed in C# and MySQL in Visual Studio. The software encourages relationships between different objects registered in the database.
[Here](https://github.com/Gfreschi/marketProject/blob/master/marketProject_SQL.txt), I'm making my SQL code available, in case you want to replicate in a different environment.
